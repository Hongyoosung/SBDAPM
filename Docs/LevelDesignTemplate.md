   ```

2. `Tick`:
   ```
   - Check win conditions every 1.0s
   - If all Team Alpha dead → Team Bravo wins
   - If all Team Bravo dead → Team Alpha wins
   - If timeout (600s default) → Draw
   - Call OnEpisodeEnd when match ends
   ```

3. `OnEpisodeEnd`:
   ```
   - Record final metrics
   - Export experiences to JSON
   - Log to CSV via ExperimentTracker
   - Trigger next episode (if batch run)
   ```

   ```

2. `Tick`:
   ```
   - Update observation

   - Build → Build Paths

7. **Lighting & Post-Processing**
   - Add `Directional Light` (sun)
   - Add `Sky Atmosphere`
   - Add `Post Process Volume` (Infinite Extent = true)

8. **Test Run**
   - PIE (Play in Editor)
   - Verify agents register with leaders (check logs)
   - Verify MCTS runs (look for "🎯 [OBJECTIVE MCTS]" logs)
   - Verify combat works (agents engage when in range)

## Advanced: Scripted Scenarios

### Dynamic Events Blueprint

For advanced curriculum, add event triggers:

**Example: Reinforcement Spawn**
```
Event: After 120s, spawn 2 additional enemies
Implementation:
  - Timer: 120s
  - SpawnActor: BP_AIAgent ×2
  - Register with Team Bravo
  - Signal event: EnemyReinforcements (priority 9)
```

**Example: Objective Progression**
```
Event: After Capture_A complete, activate Defend_B
Implementation:
  - Bind to Capture_A completion delegate
  - Activate Obj_Defend_B
  - Signal event: NewObjective (priority 8)
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Agents Don't Register with Leader
- Check `TeamLeaderTag` matches leader's tag
- Verify leader has `TeamLeader` tag
- Check `bAutoRegisterWithLeader = true`

### MCTS Never Runs
- Check `bContinuousPlanning = true`
- Verify `ContinuousPlanningInterval > 0`
- Check agents are alive (`GetAliveFollowers().Num() > 0`)

### Agents Don't Move
- Verify Nav Mesh covers play area (press `P`)
- Check AI Controller is set
- Verify StateTree component present

### No Objectives Assigned
- Check objective tags are correct
- Verify `DiscoverWorldObjectives()` called
- Check `ObjectiveManager` initialized
